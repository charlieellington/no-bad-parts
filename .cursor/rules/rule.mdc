Always follow the rules set out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/energy-flow/pages/02-developer-docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and, after every action, update [scratchpad-waitlist.md](mdc:waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/waitlist-landing/energy-flow/pages/03-projects/Waitlist-app/scratchpad-waitlist.md) the current project status. 

In building the **Waitlist Kit**, use only Tailwind CSS classes and components sourced from **shadcn/ui**. Do NOT author bespoke CSS files or React components purely for styling unless absolutely necessaryâ€”and in that case, warn the user before proceeding.
