Always follow the rules set out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:Users/charlieellington1/coding/energy-flow/pages/02-developer-docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), after every action, update references/no-bad-parts-collective/scratchpad-nobad.md the current project status. Check references/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan.mdx for context of the project. 

In building the app, use only Tailwind CSS classes and components sourced from **shadcn/ui**. Do NOT author bespoke CSS files or React components purely for styling unless absolutely necessaryâ€”and in that case, warn the user before proceeding.

Never commit API keys, secrets, or tokens (see CONTRIBUTING.md section 5 for full security rules). 

Always make sure you're updating the correct folder and application as we're often working in a two folder structure. For example, if editing or working on No Bad Parts update "no-bad-parts" - only documentation updates go into "energy-flow". 

Also check this when starting a local development server to make sure the correct app is run.
