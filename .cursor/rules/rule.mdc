Always follow the rules set out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:references/CONTRIBUTING.md) and, 
after every action, update [scratchpad.md](mdc:references/scratchpad.md) with the urrent project status. 

In building the landing page, use only Tailwind CSS classes and components sourced from **shadcn/ui**. Do NOT author bespoke CSS files or React components purely for styling unless absolutely necessaryâ€”and in that case, warn the user before proceeding.
