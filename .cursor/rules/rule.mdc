Always follow the rules set out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:energy-flow/pages/02-developer-docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and, after every action, update [scratchpad-parts-landing.md](mdc:energy-flow/pages/03-projects/no-bad-parts-collective/landing/scratchpad-parts-landing.md) the current project status. 

In building the landing page, use only Tailwind CSS classes and components sourced from **shadcn/ui**. Do NOT author bespoke CSS files or React components purely for styling unless absolutely necessaryâ€”and in that case, warn the user before proceeding.
