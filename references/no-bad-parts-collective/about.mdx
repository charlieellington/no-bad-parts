# About the [No Bad Parts Collective](https://www.nobadpartscollective.com/)

> Peer-led Internal Family Systems exploration — humans first, AI second.

[No Bad Parts Collective](https://www.nobadpartscollective.com/) is an experiment in compassionate, peer-to-peer inner-work.
Two community members meet in a private video room:
**one explores, the other facilitates**.
A silent AI agent stays backstage, streaming gentle prompts to the facilitator's
coach panel so they can stay fully present with the explorer.

## Why "No Bad Parts"?

Our name comes from Richard Schwartz's book *No Bad Parts*. Internal Family Systems (IFS) teaches that every part of you serves a purpose—none of them are "bad". We borrow these ideas but are **not** affiliated with IFS or Richard Schwartz, and certainly **not** a replacement for professional care. Think of us as a peer-led supplement for personal exploration.

## How It Works

1. **Book** — sign up and schedule a session with another Collective member.  
2. **Explore IFS** — stay present while a peer guides you through an IFS-inspired journey.  
3. **Facilitate with AI** — next time you hold space for someone else while the AI whisper-prompts in your ear.

Key principles:

- Real, face-to-face presence — no chatbot monologues.
- AI stays backstage, offering prompts so the facilitator can stay present.
- Role-swap model: everyone gives as much as they receive.

## Our Ethos

We're all equals here—there is no therapist ⇄ client divide. Yet we are **not** therapists or counsellors. If you have urgent or ongoing mental-health needs, please seek help from a qualified professional.

- **Compassion & Respect** — every part of us deserves a voice.  
- **Peer Support, Not Therapy** — a friendly place to explore, never a replacement for licensed care.  
- **Shared Learning** — we refine our approach together and welcome feedback.  

*Embrace your parts. They have much to say—none of them bad, each with its own wisdom.*
