# Notes And Planning

v.01 - Can make calls and AI listens - test it 1:1 with personal network 
v.02 - Test the above posting in forums and see if there's interest 
v.1 - Community Page + Technology (Paid Basic) - SEE BELOW 
v.2 - As above with connections to people ( Paid Pro )

Notes that got this plan: 

## d) Tiny Experiments - Chapter 10 - Community and architecting one 
- Start scrapy 
- Community aspect of no bad parts could be: 
	- Webpage with: 
	- Live Discussion: Whatsapp group 
	- How to: Documents 
	- Feedback: https://workflowy.com/features/ 
	- Feedback and Meet: next event and calendar invite sign-up - retrospective 
	- Connection: Post an ad to find a 1:1 call connection 
- If people are using this and paying a small amount for the technology, you can then build v.2. that includes connecting people and is a higher priced product. 

## a) Community not a good approach to launch a product 
- "I wanted to build products that offer the same value, regardless if they had 0 or 1000 users."
- If you build a community product, it has no value unless there are lots of users. 
- Which creates a chicken and egg problem 
- Are you building the wrong thing here because for each new user sign up who is willing, you'll also need another one of those. 
- So it won't get the traction. 
- How would I build this so any user gets the same value? 
- Ignore the community part? 
- Or, community is later, what about just building this tool for two people at a time, one can sign up, or two, and they just subscribe to use the tech. The community part, connecting people, happens on a forum or whatsapp group, or just offline with two people? 
- This fits the video idea in c) 

## b) Launch Sooner: 

What I’m learning is that I’m already ready to launch the IFS app - just talk to people 1:1 to plan the connection of two people and see what happens and gather feedback

## c) Video idea (not just IFS)
- Setup UX: 
	- Enter details and custom GPT instructions > Create video link 
- Call UX: 
	- Two people join the call 
	- User one > Does call > Has interface showing the result of their custom GPT instructions 
- Anything can be built with this - charge for the product
