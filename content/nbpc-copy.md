# No Bad Parts Collective

> A peer-led space for Internal Family Systems exploration â€” coming soon (closed alpha).

Hello! ðŸ‘‹  I'm building a community where people can guide each other through **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** sessions.  
Think of it as mutual, part-friendly coaching â€” powered by humans first, AI tools second.  
We're opening **a small closed-alpha** soon.  Sign up now and you'll:

* Shape the roadmap and unlock lifetime perks.
* See our build process in real time at **[energyflow.studio](https://energyflow.studio)**.

## Why "No Bad Parts"?
Our name nods to Richard Schwartz's book *No Bad Parts*.  
IFS teaches that every inner part has value. We borrow that philosophy â€” but we're **not** official IFS therapy, and we're **not** a substitute for professional care. We're a peer-led supplement for personal exploration.

## A Simple & Accessible Collective
Most self-help tools are solo apps; we go further.  
By pairing you with a real person, we keep you grounded in human connection while you explore your inner landscape.

## Peer-Led IFS Exploration
|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Book** | Sign up and schedule a session with a Collective member. |
| **Explore IFS** | Stay present in a meditative state while a peer guides you. |
| **Facilitate with AI** | Swap roles and guide â€” everyone gives as much as they receive. |

## How It Works
1. **Sign Up** â€” Join the wait-list and set an intention for what you'd like to explore.  
2. **Book a Session** â€” *Coming soon.* Early sign-ups get first access when booking opens.  
3. **Swap & Facilitate** â€” After receiving a session, you'll offer one in return; our ChatGPT prompt helps with facilitation wording.

## Our Ethos
* **Compassion & Respect** â€” Every part of us deserves a voice.  
* **Peer Support, Not Therapy** â€” We're a friendly space to explore, not a replacement for licensed care.  
* **Shared Learning** â€” We refine the approach together and welcome feedback.

*Embrace your parts. They have much to say â€” none of them bad, each with its own wisdom.*
